# Overview

This project has a "SpaceRoute" class that implements methods that uses doubly linked list in c++. This simulates a space mission
tracker for Voyager-210. This implementation manages way points which can be done with the many given types of methods. 

# Features
* Adding waypoints
  * addWaypointAtBeginning – Enables the user to add an element to the front of the list **(O(1))**
  * addWaypointAtEnd – Enables the user to add an element to the back of the list **(O(1))**
  * addWaypointAtIndex – Enables the user to add an element to a valid index **(O(n))**

* Removing waypoints
  * removeWaypointAtBeginning – Removes the first element of the list **(O(1))**
  * removeWaypointAtEnd – Removes the last element of the list **(O(1))**
  * removeWaypointAtIndex – Enables the user to remove an element at any valid index **(O(n))**

* Printing route
  * traverseForward – Prints your route from front to back **(O(n))**
  * traverseBackward – Prints your route reversed, back to front **(O(n))**

* Getting/Setting Waypoints
  * getWaypoint – Returns the waypoint at a specific index **(O(n))**
  * setWaypoint – Updates the name/data of the waypoint at the specific index **(O(n))**
