Spaceroute Project

This project implements a doubly linked list to manage a space mission's route. The SpaceRoute class provides methods for adding, removing, and traversing waypoints in both forward and backward directions.

Spaceroute methods:

Insertion Operations:
- Add a waypoint at the beginning of the route. 
- Add a waypoint at the end of the route.
- Insert a waypoint at a specified index.

Deletion Operations:
- Remove the first waypoint from the route. 
- Remove the last waypoint from the route.
- Remove a waypoint at a specified index.

Traversal Operations:
- Traverse and print all waypoints from the first to the last. 
- Traverse and print all waypoints in reverse order from last to first.
